# Digital Teams

### Description

Welcome to my project! This challenge was assigned during my FullStack Course at Digital College. My instructor tasked us with creating a website based on this design: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/81MASFD9jXD0J9Yf6i19PJ/Digital-Teams?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=j7xyhCLjTlKKtGDy-1), utilizing React.js. Instead of using conventional React, I opted for Next.js due to its popularity, and incorporated Sass for styling to align with Next.js's SSR capabilities. I endeavored to faithfully replicate the design while also enhancing certain functionalities. To enable user customization, I implemented localStorage to store any modifications made on the website.
